            <h3>TR-2099</h3>

            <p><strong>This is a synthesizer focused on sample creation. I use it to create drums and FX.</strong></p>
            
            <p>I describe the frequencies I want, the waveforms I want and what will happen during a time period. Then I add effects in my DAW, layer the samples I create here with real drum samples and so until I get my sound right. It is also dope for Hip Hop hats. And transitions. And noise.</p>

                <cite>...The machine is noted for its powerful bass drum sound, built from a combination of a bridged T-network sine oscillator, a low-pass filter, and a voltage-controlled amplifier. The bass drum decay control allows the user to lengthen the sound, creating uniquely low frequencies that flatten slightly over long periods...</cite><br>

            <p>But you don't need to read anything to blip and buzz this thing.<br>
                <strong>Play around and find your way to your sound</strong>.</p>

            <p>I managed to make samples around 5 minutes long in 24bit 48kHz. Always keep the script running, large files take time to render.</p>
